However suicide assailants are plainly not discouraged by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
