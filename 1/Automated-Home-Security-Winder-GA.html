<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
