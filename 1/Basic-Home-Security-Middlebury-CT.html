<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will respond. It also suggests that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would be enough to send even the most dedicated profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
