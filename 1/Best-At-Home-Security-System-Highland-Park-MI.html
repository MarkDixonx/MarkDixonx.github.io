<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home.

We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
