<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
