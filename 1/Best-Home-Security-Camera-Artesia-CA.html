Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
