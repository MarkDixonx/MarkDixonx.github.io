<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
