Or, if Arlo Pro finds a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on.

<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security innovations.

A picture of that employee exists on screen for verification (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>
