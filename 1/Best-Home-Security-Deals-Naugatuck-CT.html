<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over cross countries.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
