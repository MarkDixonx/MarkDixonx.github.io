<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your home and ownerships.

They're powered by AA batteries which can apparently last 2 years. Regrettably, due to time restrictions, I wasn't able to put that claim to the test.</p>
