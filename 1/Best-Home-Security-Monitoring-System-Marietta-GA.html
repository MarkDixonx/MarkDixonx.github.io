I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>
