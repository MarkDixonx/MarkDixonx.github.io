<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
