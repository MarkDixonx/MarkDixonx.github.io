<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies offer "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurance companies use discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments offer a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
