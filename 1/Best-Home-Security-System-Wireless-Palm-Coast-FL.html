<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment prices is extremely sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
