We first discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
