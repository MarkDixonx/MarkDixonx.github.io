You will not get a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under applicable law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by appropriate law, return a sum equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without constraint, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, changed or not returned).</p>
<p>Smart gadget combination: If you have a home filled with smart devices, think about trying to find a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can connect them.
