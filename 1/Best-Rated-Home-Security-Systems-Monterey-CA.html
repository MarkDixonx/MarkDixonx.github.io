Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notifications (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>The ADT Control app allows you to access the ADT Command platform right from your phone or other mobile device.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
