We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensing units discovered in household and small company environments. It uses reliable and budget-friendly functionality. The term passive describes the fact that the detector does not generate or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by identifying the heat emitted by other objects. </p>
