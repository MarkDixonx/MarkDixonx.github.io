<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off?

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

However, you may select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the client. </p>
