Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensing units or groups.  High-end systems allow multiple access codes, and might even permit them to be used just when, or on specific days, or only in combination with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to set up an oral code to be supplied by a licensed individual in case of incorrect alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that an additional alarm reaction is unneeded. As with access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heating system repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensing unit locations but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a pressure code to be gotten in and silence the local alarm, but still activate the remote alarm to summon the police to a burglary.</p>
