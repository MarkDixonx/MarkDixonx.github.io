<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur.
