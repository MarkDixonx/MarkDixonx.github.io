<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off).

<h3>CCTV Security System Maywood IL 60153</h3>
<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
