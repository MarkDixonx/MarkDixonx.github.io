<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables somebody to discover what they are trying to find without having to explore hours of useless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are trying to find in the taped video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful service for catching criminals and gathering evidence.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public places is good - it helps in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post crime investigation is easy and catching perpetrators is simple for law-enforcement officers. </p>
