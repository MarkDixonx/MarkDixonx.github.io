<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens may violate local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
