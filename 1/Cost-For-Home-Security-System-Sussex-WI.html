<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
