<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
