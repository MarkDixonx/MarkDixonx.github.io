Its monitoring service consists of a benefit called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm. A lot of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>

Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
