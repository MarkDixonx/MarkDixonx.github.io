<p>If you utilize Alexa to control the wise lights in your home, then you need to consider trying Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of neat techniques. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply say, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you go out the door to activate it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get a notice if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>Your area and potential hazards will determine whether hidden or noticeable cameras are best for you. You may want to hide them if you're concerned about your cameras being disabled. A mix of both can frequently be a good strategy, too. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
