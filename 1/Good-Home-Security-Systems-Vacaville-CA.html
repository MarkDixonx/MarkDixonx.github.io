With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security guard. Several cities likewise need an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

<p>Among the challenges smart alarm systems position to the consumer is the risk of being hacked. Inappropriate home network setups, defects in the devices or password compromise could enable a hacker to break into the system and figure out if anybody is home, or perhaps seize control. Though storing the vast amount of information can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs the length of time the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for example.</p>
<p>We also love that Ring still has good clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with clever home devices like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your smart outlets with your general security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
