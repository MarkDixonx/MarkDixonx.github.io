With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

You can use it even without a Ring alarm system, and if you have a Ring camera, you can submit and share clips of suspicious activity or lost animals.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.
