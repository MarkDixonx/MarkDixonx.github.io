<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions.

<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll discourage possible burglars. These signs may be affixed to a front door, a prominent window, posted in the front backyard, or at the top of a driveway.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.
