<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
