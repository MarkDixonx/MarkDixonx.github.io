<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
