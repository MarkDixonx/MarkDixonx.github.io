<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only spots that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Possibly more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should instantly know.</p>
<p>Many video surveillance cameras, in any classification, provide audio abilities. This function can be one-way, where, in addition to the video imagery, the device provides accompanying audio surveillance. It can likewise be two-way audio, which provides not just the capability to monitor the video and audio but also a way of supplying audio instructions through the camera or its accessory speaker.
