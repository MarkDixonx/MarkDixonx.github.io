<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is necessary. There are only two choices if there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup info to make this integration work.
