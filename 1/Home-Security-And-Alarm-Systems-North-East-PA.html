<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
