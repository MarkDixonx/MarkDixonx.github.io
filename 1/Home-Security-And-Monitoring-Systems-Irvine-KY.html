<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
