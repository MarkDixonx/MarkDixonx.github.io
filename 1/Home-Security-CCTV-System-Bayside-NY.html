In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
