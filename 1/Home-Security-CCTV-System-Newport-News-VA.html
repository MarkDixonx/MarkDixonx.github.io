<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
