<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of 2 piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or typically closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based upon whether or not the style is usually open or usually closed.

<p>Usually, a basic installation will cost as much as $2 per square foot of your property. Monitoring charges are between $25 and $40 monthly, with around $10 additional for intercom communication. For pet-friendly devices, an extra $50 to $300 may need required, while fire protection features tend to be $5 additional a month.
