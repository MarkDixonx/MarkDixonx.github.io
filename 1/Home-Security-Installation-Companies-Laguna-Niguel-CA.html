<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
