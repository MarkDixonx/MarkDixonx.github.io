<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy given off by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature differences. Because objects are rarely exactly the very same temperature as other objects around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars?

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
