<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
