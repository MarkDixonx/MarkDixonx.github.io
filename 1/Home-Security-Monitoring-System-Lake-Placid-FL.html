We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
