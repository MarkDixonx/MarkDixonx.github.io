<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>Wired systems use permanence and higher reliability, while wireless systems offer a high level of modification and the ease of movement.
