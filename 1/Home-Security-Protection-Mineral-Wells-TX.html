<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping consumers replace. As specialists in the market our guidance is to keep away.
