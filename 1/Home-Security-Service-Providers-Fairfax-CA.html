<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of amongst professionally set up systems. That implies even if you don't pay the month-to-month cost, the system will still inform you through your smart device if it finds a hazard, however you are responsible for calling emergency services such as the police or fire department-- so your phone needs to remain on and you require to be willing to field informs, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you do not constantly want that responsibility, such as when you're on trip.</p>
