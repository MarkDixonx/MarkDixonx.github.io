<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of two piece sensing unit that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or typically closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as when it comes to distance to the second piece which contains a magnet.

This action combined with an electric current (usually at 12V DC) permits an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are very typical and are found either wired straight to an alarm control panel, or they can usually be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
