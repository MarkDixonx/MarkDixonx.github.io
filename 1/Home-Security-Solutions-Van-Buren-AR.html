<h3>Wireless House Alarm Van Buren AR 72956</h3>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely wide area, and you can dim them via its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a celebration.

Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
