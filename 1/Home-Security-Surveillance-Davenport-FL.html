We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
