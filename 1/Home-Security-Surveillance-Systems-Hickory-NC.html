<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful assaulter, considering that the disruption of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the malicious enemy to tape these codes and use various splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
