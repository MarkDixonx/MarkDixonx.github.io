<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an economical alternative for consumers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
