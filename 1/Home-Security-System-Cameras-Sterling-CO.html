<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service implies you do not get informed until the next day? The noise may scare off would-be burglars-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. However the police won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
