<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
