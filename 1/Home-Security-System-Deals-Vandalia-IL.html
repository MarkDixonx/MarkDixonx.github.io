Modern systems now have remarkable capabilities", though these have actually produced reasonable misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and potential abuse such abilities produce.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
