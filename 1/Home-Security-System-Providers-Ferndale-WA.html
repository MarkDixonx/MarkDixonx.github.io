<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>While many companies give you the alternative to include both outdoor and indoor cameras to your security bundle, SimpliSafe's selection is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera.
