<p>Certainly, there's a huge difference between the most recent clever home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the most recent clever items, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you require (or can pay for) as well as integrate whatever to work with other wise devices such as the lighting and heating, assisting to develop an all-inclusive clever home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
