<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
