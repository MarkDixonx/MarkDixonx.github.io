Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
