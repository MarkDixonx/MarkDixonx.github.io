<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras decrease criminal activity. Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording system, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be intricate - especially if your home has already been built - so be sure to talk to an expert prior to handling the task yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not prone to disturbance such as cellular and radio frequencies. If you have a big home or property that needs detailed coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
