<h3>CCTV Security Camera Systems Prospect KY 40059</h3>

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
