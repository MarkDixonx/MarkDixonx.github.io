<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The creative bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have entered its 130-degree visual field, but it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too. Possibly more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it need to automatically know.</p>

Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
