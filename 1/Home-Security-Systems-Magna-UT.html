<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary. In truth, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to compare an individual and a cars and truck, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
