We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
