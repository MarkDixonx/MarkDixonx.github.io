<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
