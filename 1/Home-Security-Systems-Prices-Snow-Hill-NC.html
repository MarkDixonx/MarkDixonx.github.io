We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
