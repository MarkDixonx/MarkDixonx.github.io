<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
