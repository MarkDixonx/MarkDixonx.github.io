<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications may appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are created and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or missing (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video.</p>

You can extend the quantity of days you manage acquiring a membership, however I don't think most people will need that alternative.</p>
