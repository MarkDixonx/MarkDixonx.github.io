With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
