The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be taken up versus the quality of photo required or desired). The greatest image quality of DVD is just slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
