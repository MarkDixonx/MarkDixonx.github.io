<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
