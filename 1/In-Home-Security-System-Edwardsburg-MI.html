We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) fave.

The camera consists of features like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it doesn't take photos of activity and can't pan or move-- basic features found on many surveillance cameras. </p>
