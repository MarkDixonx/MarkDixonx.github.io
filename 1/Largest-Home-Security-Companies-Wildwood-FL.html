<p>On the surface area, these two camera classifications might appear similar, though if you were able to see within, the differences become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of available light, and once the lighting becomes low or absent (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Commercial cameras surpass their less expensive cousins due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adapt and record outstanding low light video.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency.

A wireless bridge is a great option for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
