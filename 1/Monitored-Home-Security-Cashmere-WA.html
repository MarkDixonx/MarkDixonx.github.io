It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it interacts with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, along with many third-party smart- home devices.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
