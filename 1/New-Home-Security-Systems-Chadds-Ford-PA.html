<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has found burglars or wild animals. Do you want to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens may break local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
