<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
