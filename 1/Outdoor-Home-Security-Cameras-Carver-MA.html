<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
