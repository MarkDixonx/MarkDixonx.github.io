<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, cops departments nationwide react to millions of false alarms from citizen and business security systems every year.

<p>Since it's more complicated than it should be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
