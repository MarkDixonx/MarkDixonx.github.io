<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<h3>Smart Home Security Monitoring in Maine</h3>
<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)
