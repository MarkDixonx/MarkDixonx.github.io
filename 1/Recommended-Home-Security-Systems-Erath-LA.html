All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current recommendation.</p>
