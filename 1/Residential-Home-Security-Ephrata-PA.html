<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular person gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has actually expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
