<h3>CCTV Security Camera Systems Landenberg PA 19350</h3>

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to add additional features, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (one of the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>The drawback? It's very easy to commit security errors that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to airplane mode is the minute you've left your house open. This open hole in your security can show to be a huge problem if you aren't careful. With a monitored system, that would not be a concern. However, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to get in touch with the authorities or other emergency services if your home remains in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and for that reason is still the much better choice for lots of who are only concerned about cost. </p>
