Along with being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light since the glass real estate doesn't hinder the lens.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security plan, the exact same company that keeps track of the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically likely, having actually a professional established the system may provide you more confidence than if you did the work yourself.
