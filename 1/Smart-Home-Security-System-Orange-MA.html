<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
