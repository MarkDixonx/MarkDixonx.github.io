<p>Mix of Male and Device: Individuals need to be out on the work-places and streets trying to avoid criminal activity or losses. CCTV cameras are simply a less effective alternative to having authorities walk the streets or security workers on patrolling and physical surveillance. As with any innovation, using cameras is by no means a replacement for good old-fashioned ground work.

The picture is clear and sharp and I discovered really little lag between my actions and the image displayed on the app. I 'd definitely state it is among the better cameras in regards to video quality.</p>
