<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
