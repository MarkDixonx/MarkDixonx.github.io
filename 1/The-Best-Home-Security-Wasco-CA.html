<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that shops it on a hard disk for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
