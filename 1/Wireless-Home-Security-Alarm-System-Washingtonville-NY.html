If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
