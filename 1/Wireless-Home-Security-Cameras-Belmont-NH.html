<p>When upon a time, installing a security system could be an extremely expensive affair: An expert monitoring company would provide the gear, locking you into an expensive, multi-year agreement.

<p>Another element to think about is security, a wireless connection is rather easy for hackers to access.

<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan however ended up discontented with its absence of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm notice while on getaway, she had no other way of assessing whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her cat had handled to trip the sensor. It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
