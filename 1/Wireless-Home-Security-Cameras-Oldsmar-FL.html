<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
