<h3>Home Video Security Systems in Victoria TX</h3>

The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be taken up versus the quality of photo needed or wanted).
