<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up far more easily than can be finished with DVR.
