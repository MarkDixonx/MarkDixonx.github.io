<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device informs with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
