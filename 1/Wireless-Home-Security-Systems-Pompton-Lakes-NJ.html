<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the minimal range of sensors. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This means that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet.
