<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and smart IR to offer up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

For somebody looking for a more intricate setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained expert to make the suggestion for the setup, professional installation is a great option.
