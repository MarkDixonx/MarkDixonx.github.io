<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
