Bear in mind that the more features and extras you add to your system, the bigger the cost. Some top-tier packages cost up of $60 per month.

<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the month-to-month monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system.

<p>Having pets indicates you will need to consider their size, movements, and any other factors that could cause issues. For instance, if you have animals that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be set up in such a way that your big family pets won't cause false alarms to be sent whenever your pet relocations. If you have large family pets, you may wish to think about skipping the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensing units which aren't activated by movement but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical option. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
