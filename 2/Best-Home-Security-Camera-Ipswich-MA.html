<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
