<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.

<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) happens when a hacker has the ability to eavesdrop on network traffic and identify the MAC address of a computer system with network privileges Many wireless systems enable some sort of MAC filtering to permit only licensed computer systems with specific MAC IDs to gain access and utilize the network.

When working with an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state needs them to be licensed. Numerous states have license requirements for alarm company. You can check the Angie's List Licensing Tool to see if your state needs licenses for home security companies.</p>
<p>Since they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of image needed or desired). The highest picture quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
