<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives. The first option, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is not available or reluctant to supply those details) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.

<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience differs commonly depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
