<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

And to be sincere, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. What you're paying for is mostly that huge name in blue. </p>
