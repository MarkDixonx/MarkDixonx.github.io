<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, because the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of data and actually indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being transferred.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential caught during the network recovery.</p>
