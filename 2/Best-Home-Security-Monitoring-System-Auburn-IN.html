Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is vital. In fact, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare an individual and a vehicle, for example, permits you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
