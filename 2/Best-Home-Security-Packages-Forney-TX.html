<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical.

With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly.
