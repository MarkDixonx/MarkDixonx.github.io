<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded police and fire actions.

Not terrific, not terrible, but with a really easy setup procedure (and trust me, that really is a killer function when it pertains to smart cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
