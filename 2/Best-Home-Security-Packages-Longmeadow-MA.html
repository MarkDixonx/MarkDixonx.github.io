Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
