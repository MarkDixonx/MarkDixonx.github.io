Thermal cameras can be paired with regular security cameras for maximum security.

We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>

Unless you only have one door and one window, you'll require more than the lone contact sensor that is available in Ring's five-piece package.</p>
