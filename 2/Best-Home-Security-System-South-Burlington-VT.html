<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an appealing edge, and we have to offer credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective burglars.
