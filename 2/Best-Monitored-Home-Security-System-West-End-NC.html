<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. The other noteworthy things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo model which I'm going to talk about in just a second), it is designed for outdoor along with indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine. It also has a USB slot so you can tape your video footage straight onto there, which saves you needing to handle the cloud storage system described above.</p>
<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we may revisit this evaluation.</p>
