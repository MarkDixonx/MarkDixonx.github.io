<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When it comes to indoor security equipment, ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors. Their detectors utilize infrared technology, so its harder for a pet dog or feline to trip the sensor. Vivint's sensors are unsusceptible to animals weighing approximately 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are immune to animals weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can personalize the sensitivity level based on your pet's size. </p>
