Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
