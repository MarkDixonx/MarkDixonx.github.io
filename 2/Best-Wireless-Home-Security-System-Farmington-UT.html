When it pertains to the EZVIZ Full HD Indoor Smart Security Cam in our best security camera round-up, the pros far outweigh the cons: it has a solid 1080p video feed, night vision, a decent 135-degree field of view, two-way audio and a simple app. Aside from the name, ADT also has a vast array of security equipment to protect your home.

That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
