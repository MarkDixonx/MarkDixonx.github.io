<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

After long-term screening this camera since we initially made it a pick in 2016, we observed that our Arlo Q started projecting a pink tint, which appears to be a continuous problem for some owners. We contacted client assistance, which used a complimentary replacement system-- even though the guarantee had long given that ended.</p>
