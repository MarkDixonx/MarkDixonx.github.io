<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it indicates you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will respond. It also indicates that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly record a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would be enough to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
