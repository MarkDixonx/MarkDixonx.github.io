The U.S. theft rate has actually decreased steadily and substantially since the early 1980s. 13 During the same time, the variety of properties with alarms rose, but there is no proof of a link between the two. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a steep increase, other kinds of criminal activity declined simply as dramatically as break-in, recommending that elements besides an increase in the number of alarm systems sustained the theft decline.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It also suggests that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would suffice to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
