We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
