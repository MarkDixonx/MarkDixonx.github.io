<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
