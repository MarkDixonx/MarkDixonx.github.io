<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the third generation of the popular Dropcam-- among the very first, and one of the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside your home. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it connects with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke alarm, in addition to various third-party clever- home devices.
