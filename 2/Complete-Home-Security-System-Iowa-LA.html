<h3>Wireless Home Security Cameras in Louisiana</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>You can configure it to record anything from a reasonable field of view right up to a complete 180-degree fish-eye, and that HDR picture comes with incredible colour depth too. Evaluating at twilight on a clear evening, the Arlo handled twenty minutes longer than its competitors at low light before changing to its night vision mode, still drawing in a clear and colourful  image.</p>
