<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over fars away.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
