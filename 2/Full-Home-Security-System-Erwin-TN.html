<p>With a professionally monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is set off, an agent will first attempt to reach you through the two-way control panel before calling your listed contact number.

The good thing about professionally set up systems is you do not need to raise a finger; after you have actually placed your order a service technician will pertain to your home, set whatever up for you, and reveal you how the system works. It is necessary to note that in some areas you might need to apply for a license to have a security system set up in your house.</p>
