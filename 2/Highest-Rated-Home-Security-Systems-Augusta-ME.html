<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
