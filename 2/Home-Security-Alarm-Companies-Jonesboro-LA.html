<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>

Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
