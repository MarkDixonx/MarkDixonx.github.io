<p>Regardless of if you choose a month-to-month expert monitoring plan or choose to self-monitor your home, SimpliSafe requires you to buy its equipment upfront.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is necessary.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to distinguish between a vehicle and an individual, for instance, enables you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
