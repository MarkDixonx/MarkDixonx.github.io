<p>Thank you men for the aid, what terrific customer servcie you offer. I purchased a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am pretty helpful to install it myself.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Activity notifications notify the user whenever significant activity is detected near the camera. Learn if you can get alerts through push alerts, text, and or email. They'll keep you abreast of anything taking place real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be honest, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're spending for is mostly that big name in blue. </p>
