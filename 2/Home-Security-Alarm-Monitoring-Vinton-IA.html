<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
