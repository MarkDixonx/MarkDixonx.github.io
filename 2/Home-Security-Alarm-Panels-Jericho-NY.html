<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
