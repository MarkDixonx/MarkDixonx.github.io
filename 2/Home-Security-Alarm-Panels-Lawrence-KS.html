After utilizing designs long-lasting for over a year, together with screening several new designs, we still think the Logitech Circle 2 is the best indoor security camera.</p>
<p>Firstly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the price.
