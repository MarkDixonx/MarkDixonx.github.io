<p>Nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your home and belongings. In the event that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to respond by instantaneously contacting you and if requirement be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<p>While some elements might be affected temporarily by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours until the electrical service is brought back.
