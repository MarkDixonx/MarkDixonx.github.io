<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Kasa Camera Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. Nevertheless, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera.

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common kind of 2 piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or usually closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether the style is normally open or typically closed. This action coupled with an electrical present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to discover a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are very typical and are discovered either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe can not ensure against burglaries or theft, like many home security system providers (except for ADT).
