<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common kind of 2 piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or usually closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet.

This action coupled with an electrical present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to discover a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are very typical and are discovered either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
