As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
