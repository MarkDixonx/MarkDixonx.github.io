<h3>Domestic Security Systems Cedarhurst NY 11516</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
