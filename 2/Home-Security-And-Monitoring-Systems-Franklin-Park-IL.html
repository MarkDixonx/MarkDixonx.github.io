<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously restricts your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home devices like lights, outlets, locks, and thermostats.

This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
