ADT gives you lots of choices. You can lease a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by a lot of the leading brands. They support a complete spectrum of wireless security features, including video monitoring, home automation, sensing units to prevent an environmental disaster, and medical signals.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
