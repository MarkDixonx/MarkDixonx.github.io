<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has detected trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens may breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to add additional features, like a security camera.

Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
