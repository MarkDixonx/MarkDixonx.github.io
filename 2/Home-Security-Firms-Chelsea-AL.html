We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
