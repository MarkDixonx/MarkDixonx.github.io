<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of as much as one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually discovered some improvements because the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and upgrade this evaluation, as required.</p>

In General, Brinks Home Security provides a quality item for a good price in a crowded market.</p>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's design - undoubtedly the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list. The handsome glossy black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine was available in a charming rose-gold but you can likewise get it in silver) strikes the ideal balance between subtle and attractive enough to not accentuate itself.</p>

We 'd probably suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're starting from scratch.</p>
