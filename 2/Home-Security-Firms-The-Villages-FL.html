<p>Cameras frequently transmit video online, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In some cases, surveillance systems are paid for and run by the cities themselves. However in other cases, organisations and residents share surveillance camera footage with law enforcement officer. Similar to any security system, the more equipment you add, the costlier it gets.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
