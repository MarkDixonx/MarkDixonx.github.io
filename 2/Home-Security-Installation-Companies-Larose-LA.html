The one time where lag does end up being a bit of an issue is in between taping and finding motion. Due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually switch on when it detects motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to record them if a nefarious wrongdoer was fast enough.</p>
