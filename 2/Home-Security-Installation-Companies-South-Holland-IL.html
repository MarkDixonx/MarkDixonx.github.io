<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
