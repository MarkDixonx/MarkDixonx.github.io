<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are designed to secure specific, tangible possessions, such as precious jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being disarmed. If the item to which the gadget has been connected is moved or disturbed, the sensing unit will activate an alarm.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll discourage potential burglars. These signs might be affixed to a front door, a prominent window, published in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway. The concept of posting a security alarm system sign is that potential criminals may not want to take a gamble about whether the sign shows the existence of a home security system.</p>

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
