<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide opponents are clearly not hindered by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system might provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
