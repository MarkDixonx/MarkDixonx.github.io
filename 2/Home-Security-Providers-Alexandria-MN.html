<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is important. In truth, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to compare a cars and truck and an individual, for instance, allows you to reduce unneeded informs. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
