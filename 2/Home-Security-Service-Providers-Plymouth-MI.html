<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
