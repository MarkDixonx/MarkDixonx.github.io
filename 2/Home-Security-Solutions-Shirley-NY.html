<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
