<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
