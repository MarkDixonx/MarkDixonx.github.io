<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99).

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer support experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
