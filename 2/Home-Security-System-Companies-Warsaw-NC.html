Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system.

It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can compare general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've identified (after a knowing period).
