<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such incidents.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present recommendation.</p>
