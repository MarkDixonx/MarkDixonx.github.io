<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
