<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection devices are developed to secure specific, tangible possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household treasures. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering innovation to avoid being deactivated. If the item to which the device has been attached is moved or interrupted, the sensor will set off an alarm.</p>
<p>Video recording isn't a standard choice on many security systems.

Video files are large, which indicates a great deal of space is needed. There are a handful of companies that offer complimentary video storage, however the video is sent to a cloud account and only kept for a few days.
