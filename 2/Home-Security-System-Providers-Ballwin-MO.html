<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
