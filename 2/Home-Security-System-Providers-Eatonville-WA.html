<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All things release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level differences. Since things are rarely precisely the exact same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>

Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
