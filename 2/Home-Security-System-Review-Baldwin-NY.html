<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually spotted burglars or wild animals.
