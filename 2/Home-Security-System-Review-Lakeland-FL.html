<p>Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Simpleness is the primary selling point of the Ring Alarm security system.
