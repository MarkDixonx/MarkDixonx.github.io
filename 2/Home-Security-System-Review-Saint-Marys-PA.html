<p>If you do experience a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should suffice to frighten burglars for the most part. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you.
