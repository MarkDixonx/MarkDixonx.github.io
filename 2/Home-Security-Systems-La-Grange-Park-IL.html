<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can select whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is triggered. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the customer. </p>
