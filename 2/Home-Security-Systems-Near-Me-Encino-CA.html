<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
