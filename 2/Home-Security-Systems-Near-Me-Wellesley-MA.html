<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
