<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation group and, once set up, is hard to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are often more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. If you've already installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the team will be able to reuse the existing circuitry.

When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
