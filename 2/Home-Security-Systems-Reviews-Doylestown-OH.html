<p>If you're looking for motion detection, the Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends out alerts straight to your phone. This camera uses a variety of features including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as extremely middle of the road. Not great, not awful, however with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that truly is a killer feature when it pertains to wise cameras.) This more recent variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone notifies with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
