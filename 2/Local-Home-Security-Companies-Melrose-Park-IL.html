Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
