<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is vital. In fact, we don't recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare a cars and truck and a person, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
