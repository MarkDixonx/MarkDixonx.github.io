<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Bullet cameras are cylindrical and long in shape and are perfect for outdoor use. Their strengths lie specifically in applications which require long distance viewing.
