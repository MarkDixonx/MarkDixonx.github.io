<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
