The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and view it later on.

<h3>Outdoor Home Security Cameras in Louisiana</h3>
<p>A wired security camera can come in 2 kinds, both needing wires to supply power and for the functions of video transmission. The camera's viewing angle identifies how much area the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, but the very best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better.</p>
<p>Often a wired system can be confused with local alarms. Nevertheless, the two are drastically different. The primary difference is that the wired system couple with the other wise home gadgets to create a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to pair with other clever devices and can not be controlled from another location. Likewise a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to signal people close by.</p>
