(A four-camera pack costs $504.72 at the time of writing.) But we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey however is important. In reality, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership.

Being able to distinguish between an individual and a car, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
