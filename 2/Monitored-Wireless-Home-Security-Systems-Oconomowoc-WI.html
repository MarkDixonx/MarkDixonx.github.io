<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
