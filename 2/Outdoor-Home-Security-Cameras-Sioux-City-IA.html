<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
