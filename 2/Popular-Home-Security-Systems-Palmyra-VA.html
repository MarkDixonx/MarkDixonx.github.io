The smart bit is that the camera not just finds that people have entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Perhaps more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to instantly know.</p>
<p>The other major decision when choosing a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will typically be developed to be more able and durable to make it through rain, frost, or damp. The downside of outdoor cameras is that they're typically mains powered and require expert installation. Luckily, I have actually evaluated out dozens of cameras and condensed whatever I've learned into the list below. These are the best home security cameras in every major sub-category, from wise doorbells to the models that work well with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri voice commands - and beyond. Let's dive in.</p>

Most of our surveillance systems consist of DVR audience software for Mac and Windows PCs, in addition to camera audience apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile phones.

The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
