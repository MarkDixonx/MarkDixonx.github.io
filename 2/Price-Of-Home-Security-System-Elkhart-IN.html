<p>A self-monitored home security system depends on the house owner to view their home and contact police in the event of an emergency. A self-monitored system does not mean a house owner needs to sacrifice any functions.

Unlike other monitoring options, self-monitored systems don't have a regular monthly monitoring cost.</p>
<p>Primarily, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the cost.

However, after nearly two years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we came across when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and vehicles.</p>

With a wireless system, you can also get push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not at home.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the best tools for supervising your home. Its wire-free design, high-resolution video, and budget friendly cloud monitoring help it stand above the competitors. Still, it is among the most expensive security cameras you can buy, so we believe the Wyze Web cam Pan is a good alternative if you're intending to conserve some dough.
