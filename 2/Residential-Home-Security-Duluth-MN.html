As infrastructure, sensing units and wiring need to be placed inside the walls, which includes drilling and connecting sensing units to low-voltage wires, so there's contractor labor to consider. Uninstalling, re-installing a system and moving is specifically bothersome and generally inadvisable, since it implies putting old hardware in a new location.</p>
<p>Your home alarm can still be set to communicate both fire and security signals to the monitoring center if you no longer use a land-line phone.
