<p>These cameras are capable of recording and transmitting very delicate information," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab. That's why we test them for data security and information privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or someone, primarily to spot or avoid crime. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the assistance of electronic monitoring and video recording. It generally includes linking video cameras to an IP network or taping gadget and monitoring the feed.</p>
<p>Motion Detection: If you're worried about video storage, check to see if the camera uses motion detection. The camera will only record when it senses movement, saving you storage space and time searching unnecessary video footage. If you want to watch on what's occurring in your home when you're not there, however you don't wish to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look.

Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
