<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
