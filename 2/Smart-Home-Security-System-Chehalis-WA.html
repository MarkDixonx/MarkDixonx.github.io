The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then stores it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>This also depends upon the provider, but you can anticipate signing a contract with providers who need expert installation of their systems.
