<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assaulter, because the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards information by avoiding it from being sent.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
