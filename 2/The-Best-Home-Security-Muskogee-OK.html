<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assaulter, because the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
