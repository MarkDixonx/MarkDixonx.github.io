<p>Consider it this way, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars? It simply does not add up. To use such low prices, producers should cut corners, and the end outcome is jeopardized performance.
