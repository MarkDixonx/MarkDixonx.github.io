<p>While every house owner worries about burglaries, uncertainty has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to incorrect alarms. Technology integration is one Vivint's strong points. The company's outstanding mobile app has been extremely rated by users on both Google Play and the App Store. It enables consumers to check live video feed, activate and shut down security systems, and handle their automated home systems including smart locks, the Philips Color system, and Nest and Element thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
