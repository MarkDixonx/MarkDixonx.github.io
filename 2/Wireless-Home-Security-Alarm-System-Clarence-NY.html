Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have additional sensing units and crucial fobs, too.</p>
