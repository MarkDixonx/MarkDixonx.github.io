The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
