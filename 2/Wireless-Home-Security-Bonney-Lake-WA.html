Over my 25 plus year career in the security market, I have actually looked into, offered, set up, and due to the fact that we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, enjoyed alarm signals for more hours than I would like to admit.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems usually do not come with upfront fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
