<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
