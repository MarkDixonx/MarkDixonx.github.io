<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, however given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
